This example Open edX custom theme package contains the bare minimum scaffolding that is required in order to begin customizing the appearance of your Open edX installation.
Note that it also includes ReactJS hooks, located in main.html just before the </body> tag, which you can use to add custom ReactJS functionality anywhere in the Open edX platform. As a reference, two example ReactJS apps are added to footer.html.
